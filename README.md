# Gender Guesser Project

## Overview
The `genderGuesser` project is a Python-based machine learning application developed as part of the CS412 Machine Learning course. It focuses on gender prediction using the CelebA dataset and employs transfer learning techniques.

## Key Features
- Utilizes the CelebA dataset for training and testing.
- Implements transfer learning methods for efficient training.
- Developed using Python and machine learning libraries.

## Dataset
The project uses the [CelebA dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), which is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Relevant Python libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, etc. (Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for exact library versions).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python genderGuesser.py

## Usage

After installation, execute the script to start the gender prediction process. The script will process the CelebA dataset and output predictions.
